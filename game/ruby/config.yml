# Configuration file. Copy to config.yml and modify as needed.

# All directories listed under load_paths will be added to the PennJSON
# extension load path. For security reasons, each extension load path contains
# two directories: A "remote" directory holding remotely loadable modules, and
# a "lib" directory added to the normal Ruby load path for library modules. All
# paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.
#
# If you do not specify an extension load path, the default extension load path
# will search "pennmush-json".
load_paths:
  - example
  - github
